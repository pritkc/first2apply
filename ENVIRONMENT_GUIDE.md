# ðŸš€ Environment Setup Guide

This guide has been consolidated into the root README. Use these canonical commands:

```bash
npm run dev:setup   # one-time developer setup
npm run dev:start   # start local development (uses dev-workdir)
npm run prod:start  # start production-like mode (cloud Supabase)
```

For full details (env files, troubleshooting, URLs), see `README.md`.
